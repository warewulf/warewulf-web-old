## The Node Configuration DB

As mentioned in the [Configuration](configuration) section, node
configs are persisted to the `nodes.conf` YAML file, but generally it
is best not to edit this file directly (however that is supported, it
is just prone to errors).

This method of using a YAML configuration file as a backend datastore
is both scalable and very lightweight. We've tested this out to over
10,000 node entries which yielded update latencies under 1 second,
which we felt was both tolerable and advantageous.

## Adding a New Node

Creating a new node is as simple as running the following command:

```
$ sudo wwctl node add n0000
Added node: n0000
```

### Node Names

For small clusters, you can use simple names (e.g. `n0000`); but for
larger, more complicated clusters that are comprised of multiple
clusters and roles it is highly recommended to use node names that
include a cluster descriptor. In Warewulf, this is generally done by
using a domain name (e.g. `n0000.cluster01`). Warewulf will
automatically assume that the domain is the equivalent of the cluster
name.

This also means that you can address groups of nodes by the cluster
descriptor with globs. For example, you are able to refer to all nodes
in "cluster01" with the following string: `*.cluster01` which is
valuable for other `wwctl` commands.

## Listing Nodes

Once you have configured one or more nodes, you can list them and
their attributes as follows:

```
$ sudo wwctl node list
NODE NAME              PROFILES                   NETWORK
================================================================================
n0000                  default
```

You can also see the node's full attribute list by specifying the `-a`
option (all):

```
$ sudo wwctl node list -a

## Setting Node Attributes

In the above output we can see that there is no kernel or container
defined for this node. To provision a node, the minimum requirements
are a kernel and container, and for that node to be useful, we will
also need to configure the network so the nodes are reachable after
they boot.

Node configurations are set using the `wwctl node set` command. To see
a list of all configuration attributes, use the command `wwctl node
set --help`.

### Configuring the Node's Container Image

```
$ sudo wwctl node set --container rocky-8 n0000
Are you sure you want to modify 1 nodes(s): y
```

And you can check that the container name is set for `n0000`:
```
$ sudo wwctl node list -a  n0000 | grep Container
n0000                Container          --           rocky-8
```

### Configuring the Node's Kernel

While the recommended method for assigning a kernel in 4.3 and beyond
is to include it in the container / node image, a kernel can still be
specified as an override at the node or profile.

```
$ sudo wwctl node set --kerneloverride $(uname -r) n0000
Are you sure you want to modify 1 nodes(s): y

$ sudo wwctl node list -a n0000 | grep KernelOverride
n0000                KernelOverride     --           4.18.0-305.3.1.el8_4.x86_64
```

### Configuring the Node's Network

To configure the network, we have to pick a network device name and
provide the network information as follows:

```
$ sudo wwctl node set --netdev eth0 --hwaddr 11:22:33:44:55:66 --ipaddr 10.0.2.1 --netmask 255.255.252.0 n0000
Are you sure you want to modify 1 nodes(s): y
```

You can now see that the node contains configuration attributes for
container, kernel, and network:

```
$ sudo wwctl node list -a n0000

n0000                default:TYPE       --           --
n0000                default:DEFAULT    --           false
```

## Un-setting Node Attributes

If you wish to `unset` a particular value, set the value to
`UNDEF`. For example:

```
$ sudo wwctl node set --cluster cluster01 n0000
Are you sure you want to modify 1 nodes(s): y

$ sudo wwctl node list -a n0000 | grep Cluster
n0000                Cluster            --           cluster01
```
And to unset this configuration attribute:
```
$ sudo wwctl node set --cluster UNDEF n0000
Are you sure you want to modify 1 nodes(s): y

$ sudo wwctl node list -a n0000 | grep Cluster
n0000                Cluster            --           --
```
